In the dynamic world of financial markets, timely and informed investment decisions are critical for maximizing returns and minimizing risks. This project aims to develop an AI-driven stock investment agent that autonomously monitors and analyzes stock performance to identify profitable investment opportunities under a specified budget. The agent utilizes data retrieved from Yahoo Finance and operates by scheduling regular checks over a predefined period, during which it tracks a selection of stocks, analyzes their daily price fluctuations, and identifies potential gains based on user-defined criteria.

The primary purpose of this AI agent is to assist investors in making data-driven decisions by continuously evaluating stock performance against set financial goals, such as a target percentage gain. By automating the monitoring process, the agent reduces the time and effort required by investors to stay updated with market trends, enabling them to capitalize on favorable market movements promptly.

This agent is designed to run autonomously in the background, executing scheduled tasks daily over a five-day period. It offers flexibility in the investment strategy by allowing users to specify the budget and target gain percentage, thus tailoring the agent's recommendations to individual financial goals. The agent's output includes alerts and investment suggestions, helping investors make informed decisions with minimal manual intervention.

Overall, this project aims to combine financial data analysis with AI-driven automation to enhance investment strategies, making the process more efficient and effective for both novice and experienced investors.
